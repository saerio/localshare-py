## How to Use the Text Sharing Web Application

Welcome to our user-friendly text sharing web application! We're excited to show you how it works. Let's get started:

### Step 1: Installation (if needed)

If you already have Python 3.x installed on your computer, great! You can skip this step. However, if you don't have Flask installed, no worries! Follow these simple steps to get Flask up and running:

1. Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
2. Type the following command and press Enter to install Flask:
   ```
   pip install Flask
   ```

### Step 2: Running the Web App

Now that we have everything set up, let's run the web application and start sharing text:

1. Save the provided code in a file named "app.py" on your computer.
2. Open your command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the folder where you saved the "app.py" file.

3. Run the application by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Now it's time to experience the magic of sharing text!

### Step 3: Accessing Shared Text

all you need to do is click on the share link you received or copy and paste it into your browser's address bar. The server will then show you the text you shared, and you can read it again or share it further with others.

### Step 4: Oops! 404 Error

If you accidentally enter an incorrect link or try to access a share that doesn't exist, don't worry! The web app has your back and will show you a friendly "Page Not Found" message.
